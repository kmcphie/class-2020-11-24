# Same data clean up as last week.

## Scene 1

**Prompt:** Create a fitted model object called `fit_1` using this formula or, if you want, a formula which you prefer. I recommend not making your model excessively complex.

primary_06 ~ solo + primary_04 + treatment + solo:treatment

(Assume that you have already completed a cross-validation analysis and chosen this one model to use going forward.)

```{r s1, cache=TRUE}
fit_1 <- stan_glm(formula = primary_06 ~ solo + primary_04 + treatment + solo:treatment,
                  data = week_11,
                  refresh = 0,
                  seed = 2020)
```

* Which data set should you use to fit the model? Explain why.

Use the full data set as opposed to splitting it into training and testing 
because we've already picked this model and we want to use the entire data set
to get the best prediction.

* Interpret the fitted model. Should we keep all these variables? And the interaction term?

```{r}
print(fit_1, digits = 4)
```




## Scene 2

**Prompt:** What is the causal effect of receiving the Neighbors postcard as compared to being in the control group? Provide a posterior probability distribution.

* One way to answer this question is to use `posterior_predict()`. Do that. Make it look nice! Write a sentence or two interpreting the answer.

```{r s2}
new_obs <- tibble(treatment = c("Control", "Neighbors"),
                  solo = TRUE,
                  primary_04 = "Yes")

posterior_predict(fit_1, newdata = new_obs) %>%
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate_all(as.numeric) %>% 
  mutate(diff = `2` - `1`) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = diff)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 100)
```


* A second approach uses `posterior_epred()`. Do that. Make it look nice! Write a sentence or two interpreting the answer.

```{r}
posterior_epred(fit_1, newdata = new_obs) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate_all(as.numeric) %>% 
  mutate(diff = `2` - `1`) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = diff)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 100)
```



## Scene 3

**Prompt:** There are four primary causal effects of interest: each of the four treatments compared, individually, to Control.  Build a big graphic which shows the four posterior probability distributions of the expected values at once. See #preceptors-notes for my version. You do not need to copy my work! Make something better!

```{r}
new_obs2 <- tibble(treatment = c("Control", 
                                 "Civic Duty", 
                                 "Hawthorne", 
                                 "Self", 
                                 "Neighbors"),
                  solo = TRUE,
                  primary_04 = "Yes")

posterior_epred(fit_1, newdata = new_obs2) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate_all(as.numeric) %>% 
  mutate(diff_cd = `2` - `1`,
         diff_haw = `3` - `1`,
         diff_self = `4` - `1`,
         diff_neigh = `5` - `1`) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = diff_cd:diff_neigh,
               names_to = "treatment_type",
               values_to = "ate") %>% 
  mutate(treatment_type = fct_relevel(treatment_type,
                                      "diff_neigh", 
                                      after = 4)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ate, fill = treatment_type)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count / sum(count))),
                   bins = 100,
                   alpha = 0.5,
                   position = "identity") +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
    theme_classic() +
    labs(
      title = "Posterior Probability Distribution for Expected Causal Effects",
      subtitle = "Postcards show neighborhood voting has biggest effect",
      x = "Change in Liklihood of Voting",
      y = "Probability"
    ) +
    scale_fill_discrete(name = "Treatment Type",
                        labels = c("Civic Duty", 
                                 "Hawthorne", 
                                 "Self", 
                                 "Neighbors"))
  
```


* Challenge question: Do the same but for both `solo = TRUE` and `solo = FALSE`. This means that there are 8 posterior probability distributions to show. Think hard about the best way to display them. What point are you trying to get across to your readers?



## Optional Question

Use a logistic model --- `stan_glm()` with `family = binomial()` --- to fit the model. How does that change the results above, especially in Scene 2. Chapter 11 provides some relevant discussion?
